# Movie Trends with RxKotlin

Utilising RxKotlin with Spring Boot to create a small service for fetching and calculating movie trends.

This is a small hobby project for trying out Kotlin and ReactiveX.
All it does is returning a JSON from endpoint `trends/{someones_name}` with some data about their 
movies fetched from popular movie rating sites and transformed using Rx philosophy.
